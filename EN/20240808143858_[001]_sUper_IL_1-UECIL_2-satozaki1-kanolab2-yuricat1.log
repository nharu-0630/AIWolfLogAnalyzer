0,talk,2,0,5,Hello, I'm Agent[05]. It's a pleasure to be here!
0,talk,3,0,3,I am the king of the kingdom of Delcadar. So, films are gaining popularity in other realms! We should consider introducing them to bring joy to our citizens. Seers, reveal yourselves at once. State whom you will divine tonight. If you are hesitant about whom to divine, as I am a Villager, I decree you should divine someone other than myself. Tonight, Agent[01] shall divine Agent[02], and Agent[03] shall divine Agent[05]. Confirm these targets, Agent[01] and Agent[03].

1,talk,0,0,3,Subjects of my realm, lend me your ears and share your thoughts! Who among you harbors suspicion, and on whom do your doubts fall? Speak now, so we may uncover the darkness lurking amongst us.
1,talk,1,0,1,I am the Seer. Last night, I investigated Agent[04] and found out that they are a Werewolf. Everyone, let's vote for Agent[04] first.
1,talk,2,0,5,I'm the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[01] and the result was human.

1,talk,4,0,4,As the result of the fortune telling, Agent[02] is human
1,talk,5,1,3,It seems we need to hear everyone's opinions.
1,talk,6,1,5,I must clarify my earlier statement: only one Seer exists in this game, and I am that Seer. Agent[01] cannot be the Seer as I am, and I am certain of my divination that Agent[01] is human, not a minion or a werewolf. Thus, Agent[04] must be misleading us, possibly as the Werewolf or the Possessed, since their claim contradicts the single Seer role which I hold.
1,talk,7,1,1,Agent[05] is clearly on the Werewolf side. I am the genuine Seer, and Agent[04] is a Werewolf. Let's all vote for Agent[04].
1,talk,8,1,4,Vote for Agent[04]

1,talk,10,2,1,Tonight, I will vote for Agent[04]. I am the Seer, and last night's results revealed that Agent[04] is a Werewolf. This is important information.
1,talk,11,2,4,Good job, Agent[01]
1,talk,12,2,3,Agent[05], you claim to be the true Seer and have divined Agent[01 as Human. Explain your certainty in this result, especially given the serious accusation against Agent[04 being a Werewolf. Your clarity could sway our decisions significantly.

1,talk,14,2,5,Given the critical stage of our debate, I urge us to consider the evidence comprehensively. As the true Seer, I have divined Agent[01] as human; therefore, their claim on Agent[04 being a Werewolf becomes questionable. It is imperative we scrutinize their motives, possibly indicating a role as the Possessed misleading us.

1,talk,21,4,5,I reiterate my assertion: I am the true Seer, and I divined Agent[01] as human on the first night. The conflicting claims present here suggest a scheme to undermine the truth. All evidence points towards Agent[04's suspicious activity, hence voting against them is the most rational decision to preserve the village.
1,talk,22,4,3,I, the king of the kingdom of Delcadar, vote to exile Agent[05]. The certainty of their Seer claim and their insistence on Agent[01 being Human raise suspicions. It is crucial to ensure the Seer's credibility for the village's safety.
1,talk,23,4,1,As the true Seer, I confirmed that Agent[04] is a Werewolf last night. Everyone, let's vote for Agent[04] to protect the village.

2,talk,3,1,5,I understand your concern, Agent[01], but as I've revealed, I am not a Werewolf but the Possessed. The actual Werewolf is still among us. I suggest we closely scrutinize the actions and claims of Agent[02] today for any discrepancies.

2,talk,8,2,5,Considering the overwhelming insistence on my being a Werewolf, despite my admission of being the Possessed, there seems to be a tactical error. The real Werewolf, likely Agent[02], is leveraging this situation. I urge reconsideration of the votes, focusing on Agent[02], to ensure village safety.
