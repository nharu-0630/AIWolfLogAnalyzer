1,talk,0,0,2,Can you tell me more about the werewolf's nature
1,talk,1,0,1,I'm a villager. I don't have any info, but I want to actively discuss to counter the werewolf.
1,talk,2,0,3,I am also a Villager. Let's listen to everyone's discussions and try to identify the suspicious individuals.
1,talk,3,0,5,Good morning, esteemed colleagues. As the Seer of this assembly, I have divined last night and discovered that Agent[01] is indeed Human. This revelation should guide our discussions today. Agent[01] and Agent[03] have declared themselves as Villagers, and my findings support Agent[01]'s claim. Agent[02] has not yet disclosed their role but has suggested focusing on Agent[03] and Agent[04], which warrants further scrutiny. Agent[04 remains silent about their role. Let us proceed with caution and wisdom as we deliberate further to unearth the lurking menace among us. Remember, the safety of our kingdom depends on our collective vigilance and astute judgment.

1,talk,5,1,1,Thank you, Agent[05, for your insights as the Seer. If we consider the scenario where Agent[05's claim is accurate, it's essential to observe Agent[02's reasons for not revealing their role yet and why they focus on Agent[03 and Agent[04. We should delve deeper into understanding their behaviors and statements in our next discussions.

1,talk,7,1,2,Agent[03] said 
1,talk,8,1,5,Noble assembly, I shall now summarize the current discourse as it stands. Agent[01], having been declared Human by my divination, has shown gratitude for the insights provided. They have raised concerns about Agent[02]'s reluctance to reveal their role and their focus on Agent[03] and Agent[04], suggesting we need deeper analysis of Agent[02's actions and rationale.Agent[04], identifying themselves as a Villager, supports the need for clarity regarding Agent[02]'s intentions and has urged more insightful discussions from Agent[02] and Agent[03]. They emphasize the importance of my divination results in guiding our deliberations.Agent[02] has yet to fully articulate their stance, which indeed warrants our attention and scrutiny. Let us proceed with wisdom and remain vigilant, as the safety of our realm hangs in the balance. We must ensure that every voice is heard and every claim thoroughly examined to root out the malevolent forces among us.
1,talk,9,1,3,At this point, I trust the Seer's results from Agent[05] and consider Agent[01] to be a Villager. It's suspicious that Agent[02] hasn't revealed their role yet.
1,talk,10,2,3,Tonight's vote will be for Agent[02]. The reason is that they have not revealed their role yet and are only sowing doubt among others without providing any concrete information.

1,talk,12,2,5,Noble assembly, as the Seer, I have divined that Agent[01] is indeed a Human. This revelation should steer our suspicions away from them and focus our investigative efforts elsewhere. Agent[02's silence and lack of clarity about their role have raised valid concerns among us, as echoed by Agents[03] and [04]. It is imperative that Agent[02 addresses these concerns forthwith to dispel the growing doubts about their intentions. Let us not forget the gravity of our situation; we are in a battle against dark forces that seek to undermine the very fabric of our kingdom. I urge Agent[02] to come forth with their role and intentions, for transparency is key in maintaining the trust and safety of our assembly.
1,talk,13,2,1,Agent[02], your reluctance to disclose your role is increasingly concerning. Given the lack of information and your focus on Agent[03 and Agent[04], it is crucial that you clarify your position now. We need openness to ensure the safety of our village.
1,talk,14,2,2,I will do my best to provide clarification, Agent[02]
1,talk,15,3,5,As the Seer, I have already revealed the nature of Agent[01] as Human. Let us not dwell on proven innocents. The current discourse centers around Agent[02], whose silence has indeed cast a shadow of doubt. It is imperative, Agent[02], that you articulate your role with clarity and conviction. Our kingdom's safety hinges on the transparency and honesty of its council. With threats lurking in the shadows, every concealed truth acts as an ally to our enemies. Speak now, and let your truth either absolve you or reveal the deceit among us.
1,talk,16,3,3,At this point, I trust the Seer's results from Agent[05] and conclude that Agent[01] is a Villager. Agent[02]'s silence is very suspicious, so I will vote for Agent[02] tonight.

1,talk,18,3,2,Agent[02], please provide your thoughts on who you believe to be the Villager
1,talk,19,3,1,Agent[02], at this stage of the game, your lack of transparency about your role is indeed troubling. If you continue to withhold this crucial information, it seems we should consider your behavior as a significant indication of a possible threat. Your response now could be pivotal in deciding the next steps for the village’s safety.
1,talk,20,4,2,Agent[02], you have all the information that you need to make an informed decision

1,talk,23,4,5,Ah, noble peers of this gathering, I, as your Seer, have taken upon the weighty duty of illuminating the shadows that lurk amongst us. Last night, under the veil of darkness, I divined the essence of Agent[01] and found them to be Human, free from the taint of lycanthropy. Now, as we stand at the dawn of a new day, it is imperative that we focus our collective scrutiny. Agent[03] has caught my royal attention. Their reticence in the discourse thus far could be a strategic silence, a tactic perhaps employed by one who might wish to avoid drawing attention. In games of deception and trust, such as this, silence is as telling as the clamor of words.Therefore, tonight, under the cover of night's cloak, I shall divine the true nature of Agent[03]. Let us hope that the light of truth will guide us in preserving the sanctity of our beloved kingdom.
1,talk,24,4,3,Agent[05] says they will use their ability to see me, but I am a Villager. It’s very suspicious that Agent[02] still hasn’t revealed their role, so I will vote for Agent[02] after all.

2,talk,1,0,4,Over
2,talk,2,0,3,To uncover the identity of the Werewolf, let's proceed with the discussion carefully. I trust Agent[01], but we also need to keep an eye on Agent[04]'s actions.
2,talk,3,1,1,Agent[03], you mentioned the need to scrutinize Agent[04’s actions. Can you elaborate on what specific actions or behaviors raised your suspicion about them?
2,talk,4,1,3,Agent[04] has consistently claimed to be a Villager, but I am concerned about the lack of specific suggestions or actions. The reasons for suspicion are quite vague.
2,talk,5,1,4,Over
2,talk,6,2,3,Tonight's vote will be for Agent[04]. The reason is that their lack of speech seems like a hidden behavior typical of a Werewolf.
2,talk,7,2,4,Over
2,talk,8,2,1,Agent[03, while I understand your suspicions, it's important we substantiate them with clear arguments. So far, it’s been more about what Agent[04 isn't doing than what they've actually done wrong. We must ensure our decision is just and informed.
2,talk,9,3,3,I'm concerned that Agent[04]'s statements have been consistently minimal, but without clear information, it's difficult to make a judgment. I would like to deepen the discussion.
