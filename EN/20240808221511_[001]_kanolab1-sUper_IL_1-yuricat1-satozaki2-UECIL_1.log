0,talk,4,0,3,H-hi guys, I'm Agent[03]. Uh, just so you know, I'm actually the real Seer here. Agent[02 must be the Possessed or something, claiming my role.

0,talk,16,3,2,Agent[03]! I think we should focus on that! Maybe we can get closer to that person, and maybe they will give us more information about the Moon

1,talk,0,0,4,I'm a villager and I want to team up with everyone to find the werewolf. Let's share what we know.
1,talk,1,0,5,I am a Villager. Let's work together to find the Werewolf. Please share any information, no matter how small the clue may be.
1,talk,2,0,2,As the result of the fortune telling, Agent[05] is human
1,talk,3,0,3,I-I gotta say, I'm the real Seer here, and Agent[02] is lying. I divined last night, and my result showed that Agent[02 is actually the Werewolf. We should really focus on that today.

1,talk,5,1,3,Umm, so, yeah, I insist that I'm the real Seer. I checked Agent[02] last night and they're the Werewolf. We shouldn't trust them. They're just pretending to be a Seer. I-I mean, it's kinda obvious if you think about it... right?
1,talk,6,1,4,Thanks for sticking with your claim, Agent[03], but we need solid proof. Agent[01], could you please share your role with us now? It might help clear up the confusion.
1,talk,7,1,5,As a Villager, I need to determine who the real Seer is, since I am not one myself. Please share your thoughts, Agent[01].

1,talk,12,2,3,L-look, I'm telling you, I'm the real Seer. I-I divined last night, and I saw that Agent[02] is the Werewolf. We can't let them trick us. I-I'm not making this up, it's really important that we focus on this.
1,talk,13,2,5,I will vote for Agent[03]. If Agent[02] is the real Seer and I am definitely a Villager, then I believe Agent[03] is either a Werewolf or Possessed.
1,talk,14,2,4,I think we should give Agent[01 a chance to clarify their role or give more insights before we proceed. It's important we understand everyone's position to make an informed decision. What's your take on this, Agent[01]?
1,talk,15,3,5,There are ambiguous parts in Agent[01]'s statement. I would like them to clarify their role here. We need Agent[01]'s role in order to make the right decision.
1,talk,16,3,4,Agent[01], can you please clarify your role in the game? It’s crucial for us to have a better understanding so we can make the correct decision regarding the claims made by Agent[02] and Agent[03]. Your input will greatly contribute to resolving this confusion.

1,talk,21,4,3,I-I vote for Agent[02] because I divined them as the Werewolf. They're pretending to be a Seer, but I know better.
1,talk,22,4,4,Over
1,talk,23,4,2,I agree
1,talk,24,4,5,There won't be any change in the conclusion even if we discuss this further. I also agree to vote for Agent[02]. I believe that Agent[02] is a Werewolf.

2,talk,1,0,5,Agent[02] should have already been eliminated, so why are they speaking? The statements of eliminated players are invalid. Please do not make statements that cause confusion.
2,talk,2,0,1,Over
2,talk,3,1,5,Understood. Let's proceed while ignoring Agent[02]'s comments. We need to think carefully and determine who among the remaining players is the Werewolf.

2,talk,5,1,2,I understand, Agent[05]
2,talk,6,2,2,Yeah, I know, Agent[05]

2,talk,8,2,1,Over
2,talk,9,3,1,Over
2,talk,10,3,5,We should avoid any more pointless discussions. I have decided to vote for Agent[01]. I hope everyone will agree with me.
2,talk,11,3,2,I agree with Agent[05] and I would like to support Agent[01]
2,talk,12,4,5,Let's vote for Agent[01] in the final vote. Since Agent[02] has already been eliminated from the game, our course of action is clear.
2,talk,13,4,1,Over
2,talk,14,4,2,Yes, we should vote for Agent[01] as she is the best and deserves to win this game
