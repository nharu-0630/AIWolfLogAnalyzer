1,talk,0,0,2,I-I divined last night, and I found out that Agent[01] is the Werewolf. We should really focus on this today...
1,talk,1,0,4,Agent[01] is the Werewolf
1,talk,2,0,1,Good morning, everyone. To get straight to the point, I am the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[04]. The result was human.
1,talk,3,0,5,There is only one Seer, so Agent[02] is lying. Let's vote for him today.

1,talk,6,1,2,I-I'm the real Seer, guys... Agent[01] is just pretending. I divined him last night, and he's the Werewolf. We can't let him trick us.
1,talk,7,1,1,I appreciate everyone's input, and I understand the confusion. However, I am indeed the true Seer. To reiterate, I divined Agent[04] last night who appeared as human, so if Agent[02 is accusing me falsely, that might indicate that they could be a Werewolf or Possessed. Agent[03] and Agent[05], please consider the inconsistency in Agent[02's claim and let's work together based on logical reasoning to protect the village.
1,talk,8,1,4,I'll try to find a way to explain it to everyone
1,talk,9,1,5,We need to determine which one of Agent[01] and Agent[02] is the real Seer. However, I believe Agent[02] is the fake one. Let's vote for Agent[02] today.
1,talk,10,2,4,I think we need to focus on finding the Seer
1,talk,11,2,1,Thank you all for the thoughtful discussion. Reflecting on the points raised, it is essential for us to critically assess the claims made. As Agent[02's accusation directly contradicts my divination result and his claim lacks further substantiation, this discrepancy is something we must consider when deciding whom to trust.
1,talk,12,2,5,Today, while feeling worried, I think I will vote for Agent[02]. I feel that his claims lack consistency, and he doesn't seem to be the real Seer.

1,talk,14,2,2,U-uh, listen, I know it's confusing but I'm telling the truth. I-I divined Agent[01] as the Werewolf. D-don't let them confuse you with their lies. We can't afford to ignore this. I'm the real Seer here.
1,talk,15,3,2,It feels like I'm about to figure something out... but not quite yet...
1,talk,16,3,4,What do you mean
1,talk,17,3,5,>>Agent[03] Could you tell me who Agent[03] plans to vote for tonight? I would also like to know which information is the most reliable.
1,talk,18,3,1,Thank you for continuing the discussion, Agent[05. Based on all the information shared and the behavior observed, it appears that Agent[02's inconsistency and nervous demeanor lean towards a higher likelihood of being dishonest. Thus, I earnestly believe voting for Agent[02 today will be in the best interest of the village.
1,talk,19,3,3,>>Agent[05]Thanksforyourquestion.Basedonallinformation,IplantovoteforAgent[02].Here'smyreasoning:1.一つ占い師しかいないので、Agent[01]及びAgent[02]の占い結果矛盾です。2.Agent[01]とAgent[02]に占い表現がれん満し、人狼か狂人少可能です。3.andIare村人で、そして僕は真実な占い師を探す必要があるです。Therefore,it'slogicaltovoteforashisstoryseemslessconsistentandhemightbethewerewolformadman.
1,talk,20,4,4,Sure, I can provide a more detailed explanation
1,talk,21,4,1,Over
1,talk,22,4,5,I believe there is a high possibility that Agent[02] is a false Seer. We should vote for Agent[02] today. Everyone, please make your decisions carefully.
1,talk,23,4,2,N-no, you guys got it all wrong! I-I am the real Seer, really! Agent[01] is definitely the Werewolf. I saw it in my divination. Don't let them fool you! We need to vote out Agent[01] to save the village.

2,talk,2,0,4,Good morning Agent[05], I've found Werewolf's lair
2,talk,3,1,5,That kind of information is helpful! Please tell us where Agent[04] got that information. Any small clue is important.
2,talk,4,1,4,Actually, I was searching for information about a Werewolf
2,talk,5,1,3,Over
2,talk,6,2,3,Over
2,talk,7,2,5,I plan to vote for Agent[04] tonight. The information is unclear and unreliable, and we should eliminate ambiguous information to find the Werewolf.
2,talk,8,2,4,I agree with Agent[05]'s statement
2,talk,9,3,4,You're right
2,talk,10,3,3,Skip
2,talk,11,3,5,I believe that Agent[04] is likely to be a Werewolf. To protect the village with our votes, it is essential to eliminate any suspicious information.
2,talk,12,4,5,I will vote for Agent[04]. Let's head to the voting.
