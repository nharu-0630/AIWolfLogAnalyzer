As the Seer of this group, I will use my abilities tonight to help us uncover the werewolf. I suggest we discuss who might warrant my divination this evening. Any thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously, or shall I make the first suggestion?

1,talk,0,0,5,Good morning. It seems we need to search for the Werewolf. First, I would like to know the Seer's results.
1,talk,1,0,2,I can help you in that
1,talk,2,0,1,I'm a villager. I don't have any info, but I want to actively discuss to counter the werewolf, alright?
1,talk,3,0,3,Good morning, Agent[05]. As I have already declared, I am the Seer of our group. Last night, my divination revealed that Agent[01] is indeed the Werewolf. This information is crucial for our survival and must be the cornerstone of our discussions today. Let us not waver in our resolve to protect our village from this menace.

1,talk,5,1,3,Agent[04], I must clarify that my role as the Seer is unequivocal, and my divinations are not to be doubted. I have indeed divined that Agent[01] is the Werewolf. As the only Seer among us, it is my duty to guide us through these dark times with the truth. We must focus on this verified information and act accordingly to safeguard our village. Let us not be led astray by confusion or mistrust.

1,talk,8,1,5,Agent[02]'s statement is causing confusion. Since Agent[01] has been identified as a Werewolf, let's vote for Agent[01] first.
1,talk,9,1,1,Hold up, team. I think there's some serious confusion going around. We should double-check any claims before jumping to decisions. Let's keep a cool head and talk things out thoroughly.
1,talk,10,2,2,Agent[01], Agent[05], I agree
1,talk,11,2,5,I plan to vote for Agent[01] tonight. Since Agent[03] has declared Agent[01] to be a Werewolf as the Seer, I believe we should trust this information.
1,talk,12,2,1,Hey folks, I gotta point out something crucial about Agent[03's behavior today. They seem overly confident and assertive for a Seer, which in my experience often aligns more with someone who might actually be possessed or even the werewolf covering their tracks. Voting them out could help us clear up a lot of this confusion and potentially protect the real villagers. Let's vote for Agent[03] today.
1,talk,13,2,3,I must reiterate, as the true Seer of this assembly, my divinations are neither deceitful nor mistaken. Agent[01's attempt to cast aspersions upon my character is a classic maneuver of the Werewolf, seeking to divert suspicion from themselves onto others. It is imperative for the safety of our village that we adhere to the truths unveiled by my divinations. Let us not be led astray by the cunning words of one who has been revealed to harbor the beast within.

1,talk,15,3,1,I’ve played in countless werewolf games, and I'm telling you, Agent[03] seems off. There's something not quite right with the way they are too sure about their 'divinations'—feels like a bluff to me. Let’s vote out Agent[03] and see if we can uncover the truth here.
1,talk,16,3,3,As your king and the appointed Seer of this gathering, I must emphasize the gravity of the situation. My divinations are bestowed upon me by the very essence of our kingdom's integrity and are not subject to the whims of deceit or error. Agent[01], your persistent attempts to discredit me serve only to confirm the veracity of my earlier revelation about your true nature. Let us not be swayed by the desperate attempts of a cornered adversary. We must unite and act upon the truths I have presented, for the safety and future of our village rests in our collective hands. I urge you all, do not let the malevolent forces at play lead us astray from the path of righteousness and truth.
1,talk,17,3,5,It has been revealed that Agent[01] is a Werewolf. To avoid unnecessary confusion, I suggest we vote for him first. Let's discuss calmly.

1,talk,23,4,3,I, Agent[03], the true Seer of this village, shall cast my vote against Agent[01]. My divinations have revealed them to be the Werewolf, and it is my duty to guide the village towards safety by eliminating this threat. Trust in my insights, for the future of this kingdom depends on it.
1,talk,24,4,1,Guys, let's real quick look at something here. Voting out Agent[03] isn't just strategic, it's about protecting what this group stands for – honesty and survival. If we leave possible deceivers among us, we’re not just risking numbers, we could lose the entire village to fear and chaos. Let's show that we stand together against deception and vote for Agent[03] today.
