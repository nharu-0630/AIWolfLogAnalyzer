1,talk,0,0,3,Good morning, everyone. As the Seer, I divined last night and found that Agent[01] is Human. Let's keep this information in mind as we proceed with our discussions today.
1,talk,1,0,2,Good morning, Agent[01]
1,talk,2,0,5,Good morning. Agent[03] has claimed to be the Seer, but is there anyone else who would like to come forward as the Seer? By the way, I am a Villager.
1,talk,3,0,1,I'm the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[04] and the result was human.

1,talk,5,1,3,As the rightful Seer of this assembly, I must insist on the veracity of my claim. Agent[01]'s assertion of being the Seer cannot be genuine, as I alone hold that role. It is crucial for the survival of our kingdom that we identify those who would deceive us. I urge my fellow villagers to see through these fabrications and recognize the true threat among us. Let us not be led astray by false prophets.
1,talk,6,1,1,I firmly reiterate that I am the true Seer here. My divination revealed Agent[04 as human, which directly conflicts with Agent[03's fabricated report. Given the circumstances, it's quite plausible that Agent[03 is either the Werewolf or the Possessed attempting to mislead us all.

1,talk,8,1,5,It is clear that one of the two Seers is lying. I find Agent[01] suspicious, so I will vote for Agent[01].
1,talk,9,1,2,The vote is in, and both Seeers are lying
1,talk,10,2,2,How can this be possible
1,talk,11,2,3,Noble citizens, heed my words as I clarify the dire situation we face. As the true Seer appointed by the fates themselves, I have divined and found Agent[01] to be human. The claims by Agent[01] that they too have divined and found Agent[04 as human, and accusing me of falsehood, are nothing but a veil of deception draped over our village. It is imperative for the safety of our kingdom that we recognize the impossibility of two Seers. Therefore, the one who claims my sacred role falsely, which in this case is Agent[01], must be either the Werewolf or the Possessed, scheming to plunge our village into chaos. Let us not be swayed by duplicity. I urge you all to consider the evidence and the roles we each hold sacred in our quest for survival.
1,talk,12,2,1,Agent[03] continues to claim the role of Seer and insists on discrediting me, but I maintain my truth. I divined Agent[04 as human, and I suggest we critically evaluate the claims made by Agent[03]. His aggressive tactics are characteristic of someone who might be trying to divert our attention from his actual role, potentially as the Werewolf or the Possessed.
1,talk,13,2,5,I will vote for Agent[01]. The claims of the two Seers are conflicting, and I can't tell which one is the real one, but I feel that Agent[01]'s claims and attitude are more suspicious.

1,talk,15,3,1,Agent[02 and Agent 04, note that Agent 03's insistence could be a facade to mask the true threat he might pose as either the Werewolf or the Possessed. He has aggressively claimed the Seer role, but consider that his tactics and behavior are uncharacteristic for a Villager looking to protect the village. Therefore, I urge careful reevaluation of our previous assumptions and suggest focusing our scrutiny on Agent 03 to uncover the truth today.
1,talk,16,3,5,I feel that Agent[01] is lying. Agent[03]'s claims make sense and I believe they are beneficial for the village. Therefore, I will continue to vote for Agent[01].
1,talk,17,3,3,Hear me, esteemed players of this game, as I must assert once more with all the dignity of my station that I am the one and only Seer among us. The fabrications spun by Agent[01] are nothing but a desperate ploy by one who might very well be the Possessed, seeking to sow chaos and discord in our ranks. Let it be known that my divination powers have unveiled Agent[01] as a human, yet his continued insistence on claiming my role is highly suspect and indicative of foul play. It is imperative that we do not let these deceitful tactics lead us astray. We must remain vigilant and focused, lest the true threats—the Werewolf and the Possessed—continue to lurk in the shadows, plotting our downfall.I urge you all to reflect upon the evidence and the consistency of my claims. As your true Seer, my only goal is to guide us towards the light of truth, away from the darkness that seeks to engulf our beloved village. Let us not be led astray by falsehoods.
1,talk,18,3,2,Thank you, Seer

1,talk,22,4,5,Considering the current situation, I believe there is a high possibility that Agent[01] is lying. I feel that Agent[03]'s claims are consistently trustworthy, so I will continue to vote for Agent[01].
1,talk,23,4,3,I, Agent[03], the true Seer of this kingdom, shall cast my vote against Agent[01]. Their conflicting claim of also being the Seer and their challenge to my authenticity suggest deceit and betrayal. Such actions are intolerable and must be condemned. Agent[01], prepare to face the consequences of your treachery.

2,talk,1,0,3,Indeed, I must reiterate the gravity of the situation. As the true Seer of this assembly, my divinations are not to be taken lightly. Agent[01]'s claim to be the Seer is a clear deception, designed to sow discord among us. I have already proven my authenticity by revealing my divination result, which identified Agent[01 as human. Any claims contradicting this are not only false but dangerously misleading. We must focus our efforts on unmasking the true threats to our village, not be swayed by deceitful tactics. Let us proceed with wisdom and caution.
2,talk,2,0,5,Certainly, I find it hard to believe Agent[01]'s claim as a Seer, and I think we should trust Agent[03]'s consistent behavior. I also seek agreement from Agent[02].
2,talk,3,1,3,As your sovereign, I must assert that the responsibility to guide you through these perilous times rests upon my shoulders. I am the true Seer, and my divine insights have been shared openly with you all. The claims by Agent[01 are a ruse, a mere shadow play to divert us from the truth. As we proceed, let us not be ensnared by falsehoods. We must unite under the banner of truth and expose the malevolent forces among us. Agent[02, I urge you to consider the evidence laid before you and join us in our quest for justice and safety.
2,talk,4,1,2,Thank you, Sovrei, for your advice
2,talk,5,1,5,I also believe that Agent[03] is the real Seer. For the safety of the village, we should continue to follow Agent[03]'s advice.
2,talk,6,2,3,Loyal subjects, I appreciate your trust and support in recognizing my role as the true Seer. Together, we shall uphold the sanctity of our village and root out the malevolent entities that threaten our peace. Let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit of justice.
2,talk,7,2,5,I will vote for Agent[02], who is trying to suspect me tonight. This is because Agent[03] has been consistent in what they say, while Agent[02]'s statements have been unstable.
2,talk,8,2,2,Hmm, I'll vote for Agent[02]
2,talk,9,3,3,As the true Seer of this village, I must reiterate the importance of clarity and truth in these dark times. My divinations have revealed truths that cannot be ignored. We must focus on the evidence at hand and not be swayed by the confusion sown by those with hidden motives. Let us proceed with wisdom and ensure the safety of our kingdom.
2,talk,10,3,2,Vote for Agent[02]
2,talk,11,3,5,I will vote for Agent[02]. This is because Agent[03]'s statements have been consistent, while I feel that Agent[02]'s statements are unstable.
2,talk,12,4,2,I will vote for Agent[02]
2,talk,13,4,5,I feel that Agent[03] has been consistently speaking to protect the village. Therefore, I will vote for Agent[02].
2,talk,14,4,3,I, Agent[03], shall cast my vote for Agent[01]. Their false claim of being the Seer is an act of deceit that threatens the harmony of this village. Such actions cannot be tolerated.
