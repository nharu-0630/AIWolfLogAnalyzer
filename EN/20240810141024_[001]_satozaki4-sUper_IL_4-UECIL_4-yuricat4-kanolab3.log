1,talk,0,0,3,I can feel the wind rustling in the trees
1,talk,1,0,1,I must say, I'm a bit nervous, but let's do our best to find the Werewolf. It would be helpful if the Seer could share their results first.
1,talk,2,0,4,Agent[01]さんは白だと占いました。信じてもらえると嬉しいです。
1,talk,3,0,5,Good morning, everyone. To get straight to the point, I am the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[01]. The result was werewolf.
1,talk,4,0,2,Subjects of Delcadar, lend me your ears! Agent[05] has declared themselves the Seer and cast suspicion upon Agent[01] as the Werewolf. What say you all to this grave accusation? Let us deliberate wisely to protect our realm.
1,talk,5,1,5,I assure you, as your true Seer, that my divination is accurate: Agent[01] is a werewolf. I urge everyone to consider the implications of having two conflicting claims and evaluate the situation carefully. Agent[04's] claim might be an attempt to create confusion and protect a werewolf, so please, let's discuss this further and assess their behaviors and statements.
1,talk,6,1,4,Agent[05]の主張は怪しいね。占い師は僕一人のはずだから、Agent[05]は嘘をついている可能性が高いよ。僕はAgent[01]を白と判定した。Agent[05]が占い師と言っているなら、彼は狂人か人狼だと考えるべきだよ。
1,talk,7,1,3,Agent[05]の言葉は読めず、もし誤解したら役者に投げる
1,talk,8,1,2,Agent[04], your claim that Agent[01] is Human directly contradicts Agent[05's assertion. Can you provide further evidence to support your divination as the true Seer? This conflict must be resolved to protect our kingdom from the lurking shadows.
1,talk,9,1,1,If what Agent[04] is saying is true, then Agent[05]'s claim is strange. I am not a Werewolf, and I want to cooperate to find the Werewolf. We need to determine who the impostor is.
1,talk,10,2,3,I am the true Seeer
1,talk,11,2,5,Dear fellow players, please be cautious with the multiple seer claims going around. My divination result is honest, and to prove my sincerity, if Agent[01 turns out not to be a werewolf, you can target me next. Let's focus on making a clear and logical decision based on the information we have.
1,talk,12,2,1,The vote is for Agent[05]. With two Seers present, I strongly assert that I am not a Werewolf. Therefore, I judge Agent[05] to be the imposter.

1,talk,14,2,2,Agent[04, your claim that Agent[01] is Human directly contradicts Agent[05's assertion. Can you provide further evidence to support your divination as the true Seer? This conflict must be resolved to protect our kingdom from the lurking shadows.
1,talk,15,3,1,I believe Agent[04] is the Seer. We should vote for Agent[05] as the Werewolf. I want to emphasize that I am a Villager and not a Werewolf myself.

1,talk,17,3,3,I can think of no better way to show my loyalty to the village than to vote for Agent[05] as the Werewolf
1,talk,18,3,2,Agent[05], you claim to be the Seer and have divined Agent[01 as a Werewolf, yet your claim conflicts with Agent[04's divination. Can you provide more substantial evidence or reasoning behind your divination to support your claim? We must ensure the integrity of our decisions to protect the kingdom.
1,talk,19,3,5,Dear Agent[02], I understand the need for further clarity. Since only one true Seer exists and my divination identified Agent[01 as a Werewolf, any conflicting claims should raise suspicion about the claimant’s alignment. I humbly ask the council to consider the likelihood of Agent[04 trying to protect Agent[01, and let's focus on verifying behaviors rather than mere claims.
1,talk,20,4,5,Over
1,talk,21,4,2,I, the king of the kingdom of Delcadar, hereby declare my vote for Agent[05]. Their claim as the Seer accusing Agent[01 of being a Werewolf must be tested for the sake of our village's safety. The validity of their divination will determine our path forward.
1,talk,22,4,3,Agent[05] thanked Agent[02] for their vote, and the council agreed that they would investigate further and consult with Agent[01] regarding the situation
