1,talk,0,0,3,I'm a villager and I want to team up with everyone to find the werewolf. Let's share what we know.
1,talk,1,0,5,I am the Seer. I have already investigated Agent[02], and he is a human. Everyone else, please share your information.
1,talk,2,0,2,Hear me, subjects of Delcadar! I implore each of you, Agents[01], [03], [04], and [05], to declare your insights and suspicions. Who amongst us do you believe harbors deceit? Speak now, for the safety of our realm depends on your honesty.
1,talk,3,0,1,Alright,Agents,let'sdiscussourroles.Agents[02]and[05]bothclaimtobeSeers.However,therecanonlybeone.Seer,whomdidyouinvestigateandwhatdidyoufind?Thiswillhelpusdeterminewhomaybelying.
1,talk,4,0,4,Agent[03]and[04],may I be ofassistance
1,talk,5,1,3,Agent[04], could you please clarify your role in this game and share any information or suspicions you have? It's important for all of us to be transparent so we can make informed decisions. Likewise, I'm curious what insights Agent[01] and Agent[02 have on the role each claims to hold.
1,talk,6,1,4,Agent[04], I apologize if my previous statements were not clear
1,talk,7,1,2,Agent[04], as a fellow participant in this council, I urge you to clarify your role and any divinations you might have conducted. It is vital for the safety of our kingdom to understand where you stand. Your transparency will guide us in making informed decisions.
1,talk,8,1,5,Agent[04], please share your role and information. Everyone's transparency will help us in our decision-making. Other agents, please express your thoughts clearly as well.

1,talk,10,2,5,Based on my divination, Agent[02] is a human. Therefore, since Agent[01] seems to be suspicious of other villagers, I feel that he is the Werewolf, so I will vote for Agent[01] today.
1,talk,11,2,4,The Werelion and the Werelioness are in a race to see who can be the first to capture the beast
1,talk,12,2,2,My fellow villagers, heed my words. Agent[01] casts doubt without providing his own divination results, which raises suspicion about his true intentions and role. Let us consider the possibility that Agent[01, by not providing clear evidence and sowing confusion, may indeed be the Werewolf or the Possessed we seek to unmask.

1,talk,14,2,3,Given the ongoing uncertainty and conflicting claims about the Seer's role, it's vital we resolve this to focus our suspicions correctly. Agent[02] and Agent[05], could you both elaborate on your reasons for your respective claims and any additional findings you might have? This clarity is crucial for our next steps in identifying the Werewolf among us.
1,talk,15,3,4,GiventhatthereisonlyonetrueSeer,eiitherorislying
1,talk,16,3,5,When I see Agent[01] suspecting other Villagers, I feel there’s a high possibility that he is a Werewolf. I would like to hear everyone else's opinions as well.
1,talk,17,3,2,Agent[01], your skepticism towards both Agent[05] and myself, without providing your own clear role or divination results, raises doubts about your intentions. I urge the council to consider the possibility that Agent[01 may be the Werewolf or the Possessed, as he sows confusion without substantiating his claims. Let us scrutinize his statements further to uncover the truth for the safety of Delcadar.

1,talk,19,3,3,Thank you all for sharing. Since the role of Seer is currently the most contested, I would like to focus on the claims made by Agent[02] and Agent[05]. I'll need to hear specific details from Agent[02] about any divinations to better compare the reliability of the claims with Agent[05’s insights.
1,talk,20,4,3,Over
1,talk,21,4,2,I, the king of Delcadar, cast my vote for Agent[01]. His lack of transparency and failure to provide divination results raise suspicions of deceitful intentions. This behavior is not befitting of a loyal villager, and thus, I believe he may be the Werewolf or the Possessed.
1,talk,22,4,5,I will also vote for Agent[01]. His suspicious attitude towards the other villagers seems unnatural, and he is likely a Werewolf. I would like to hear everyone else's opinions as well.
