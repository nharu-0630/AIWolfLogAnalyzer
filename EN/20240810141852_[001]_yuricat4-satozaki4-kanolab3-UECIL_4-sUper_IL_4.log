1,talk,0,0,5,Good morning. It seems we need to search for the Werewolf. First, I would like to know the Seer's results.
1,talk,1,0,4,I have seen some sightings of Werewolves in the nearby woods
1,talk,2,0,1,Goodmorning,everyone!Let'sstartbyhearingfromtheSeer.Whodoyouthinkweshouldfocusonforinvestigation?
1,talk,3,0,3,I'm a villager. I want to work with everyone to find the werewolf and keep our village safe. Please share your info, okay?
1,talk,4,0,2,Good morning once again. As I have previously stated, I am the Seer of our group. Last night, I divined Agent[03] and found them to be Human. This knowledge should guide our discussions today. Let us use this information wisely to uncover the true threat among us.
1,talk,5,1,4,Agent, our village is at risk of being taken over by a werewolf
1,talk,6,1,5,Understood. The first seer's results are in, so let's discuss based on that. Since Agent[03] has been confirmed as a villager, let's find the werewolf among the other four.
1,talk,7,1,2,As the Seer, I have done my duty by revealing the nature of Agent[03] as human. It is imperative now that we scrutinize the words and actions of Agents[01], [04], and [05] with utmost vigilance. Let us not be swayed by mere words; instead, let us seek the truth through careful observation and strategic questioning. Who among you, Agents [01], [04], and [05], would you suspect based on the current discourse and why? Let us proceed with wisdom and caution.
1,talk,8,1,3,Thanks for your divination, Agent[02]. Since I'm indeed a Villager, your findings help us focus on the others. Let's hear from Agents[01], [04], and [05] about their roles and any suspicions they might have.

1,talk,10,2,5,I am a Villager. I plan to vote for Agent[04] tonight because their statements are vague and they are not providing specific information.
1,talk,11,2,2,Loyal subjects, it is my duty as your Seer to guide this discussion with clarity and purpose. We have heard Agent[05] claim the role of a Villager and express suspicion towards Agent[04] due to their lack of specificity. This is a point worth considering. However, we must also be wary of swift judgments without substantial evidence. Agent[01] has also declared themselves a Villager, leaving Agent[04's role yet to be clarified by their own words. Let us hear from Agent[04] directly. What say you about your role and your perspective on the suspicions cast upon you?
1,talk,12,2,1,>>Agent[04]Whatisyourrole,andhowdoyourespondtoAgent[05]'ssuspicion?Weneedyourinputtoproceedwithouranalysis.
1,talk,13,2,3,I appreciate the clarity provided by Agent[02] about my status as a human. Since we are trying to figure out who the werewolf is, it's important everyone clearly states their role. Agent[04, please clarify your role so we can all make well-informed decisions moving forward.
1,talk,14,2,4,Yes, Agent[01]
1,talk,15,3,3,Agent[04], we still haven't heard a clear statement about your role. Could you please specify whether you are a Villager, Seer, or something else? This will help us all in deciding our next steps effectively.

1,talk,17,3,2,As the Seer, I have already divined that Agent[03] is human, which corroborates their own claim. Agent[01] and Agent[03 have both claimed to be Villagers, and with my confirmation of Agent[03]'s humanity, the attention must indeed turn towards Agent[04] and Agent[05]. It is imperative that Agent[04] clarify their role immediately. Transparency is crucial in our quest to root out deceit and treachery within our ranks. Let us not delay in casting light upon the shadows where doubt festers.
1,talk,18,3,5,I suspect Agent[04] because he hasn't clearly discussed his role yet. I find it suspicious that his information is unclear.
1,talk,19,3,4,It appears that Agent[05] is indeed right

1,talk,21,4,3,Over
1,talk,22,4,5,It is very suspicious that Agent[04] is not clearly indicating their role. Let's check everyone's information before voting and make a careful decision.
1,talk,23,4,2,Indeed, the discourse amongst us reveals a tangled web of suspicion and uncertainty. As your king and the appointed Seer of this assembly, it is my duty to clarify the shadows that cloud our judgment. From the utterances made this morn, it appears that Agent[04] and Agent[05] are at the heart of our conundrum, each casting doubt upon the other.Reflecting upon the words of Agent[01], who brings to light a potential discrepancy in the claims of village membership, and the pointed suspicions directed at Agent[04] by Agent[05], I am compelled to use my divine power tonight to inspect Agent[04]. A clear vision of Agent[04]'s true allegiance will undoubtedly aid us in navigating these treacherous waters. This decision, I decree, is in the best interest of our kingdom and will bring us closer to unmasking the deceit that lurks among us. Let us proceed with caution and keep our wits about us as the night falls.
