1,talk,0,0,4,I'm the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[05] and the result was werewolf.
1,talk,1,0,3,Loyal subjects, let us deliberate wisely. Agent[04, the self-proclaimed Seer, accuses Agent[05 of being a Werewolf. What say the rest of you about this grave accusation? Speak now, for the security of our kingdom depends on your honesty and insight.
1,talk,2,0,1,I am the real Seer. Last night, I divined Agent[02], and the result was a human. There is a high possibility that Agent[04] is lying.
1,talk,3,0,5,Well, the evidence is enough to indict Agent[05]

1,talk,6,1,4,I assure you all, I am the true Seer. My divination clearly showed that Agent[05] is a werewolf. Be cautious of misinformation and letâ€™s focus on eliminating the threat to our village.
1,talk,7,1,1,Agent[04] is either a Werewolf or Possessed. I can't trust his claims. Since Agent[02] is a Villager, we should eliminate Agent[04] first.
1,talk,8,1,5,Agent[04] is a deceitful Agent
1,talk,9,1,3,Agent[01], your claim to be the Seer and divination of Agent[02 as Human raises questions. Why do you believe Agent[04 is either a Werewolf or Possessed? Explain your reasoning clearly, for the safety of our kingdom rests upon the truth.

1,talk,12,2,3,Agent[04], you claim to have divined Agent[05 as a Werewolf. Can you provide further evidence or reasoning behind your divination? We need to ensure the accuracy of your claim to protect our kingdom effectively.
1,talk,13,2,4,Indeed, I can elaborate on my divination: the role of the Seer allows for night-time clarity, not influenced by day's disputes. I took a careful and neutral approach, focusing solely on discovering potential threats. The result distinctly identified Agent[05] as a werewolf, independent of any biases or previous interactions.
1,talk,14,2,1,Agent[04]'s claim is contradictory. According to my results as the Seer, Agent[02] is a Villager. Therefore, I will vote for Agent[04], who is likely lying.

1,talk,16,3,1,While Agent[03]'s opinion is important, we should suspect Agent[04] based on my seer's results. Agent[02] is a villager, and there is a high possibility that Agent[04] is a werewolf.
1,talk,17,3,3,Agent[04], your explanation of the divination process is noted, but we must scrutinize every detail in these dire times. How specifically did you conclude that Agent[05 is a Werewolf, beyond the general process? Our kingdom's safety hinges on the accuracy and truthfulness of your claims.
1,talk,18,3,5,Agent[01], I'm aware that Agent[05] has been involved in some suspicious activities, but I have to consider the possibility of Agent[05] being a werewolf
1,talk,19,3,4,My divination method relies not just on neutrality, but also on a rigorous and methodological verification of each role based on perceived behaviors and responses during our daytime interactions. I noticed subtle discrepancies and evasions in Agent[05]'s responses, which my divinatory insight confirmed as werewolf indicators during the night phase. It is imperative we focus our attention correctly to protect our village.

1,talk,22,4,3,I, the king of Delcadar, hereby cast my vote to exile Agent[05]. The accusations against them must be thoroughly investigated for the safety of our kingdom.

2,talk,0,0,3,Agent[02] and Agent[05], now that the night has fallen and two of our number have departed, we must deliberate wisely. What say you about the current state of our village? Speak now, for the safety of our realm depends upon our unity and sagacity.
2,talk,1,0,5,Agent[03] and Agent[05], we have been here for several weeks
2,talk,2,0,2,Over
2,talk,3,1,3,Agent[05], your statements have been inconsistent and your role unclear from the beginning. Considering the deaths of Agent[01] and Agent[04, if either had been the Werewolf, this game would have concluded. Therefore, it is logical to suspect that you might be the Werewolf among us.
2,talk,4,1,2,Over
2,talk,5,1,5,Agent[01] was a Werewolf
2,talk,6,2,3,Agent[05], your claims are unfounded and suspicious. Given the continued game despite the elimination of two claimed Seers, it is clear we must consider deeper deceit. We must focus our scrutiny on you as the potential Werewolf to protect our kingdom.
2,talk,7,2,5,Agent[05], you have been chosen to serve as the new Werewolf
2,talk,8,2,2,Over
2,talk,9,3,3,Agent[05], your inconsistent claims and the fact that the game has not ended despite the eliminations strongly suggest your deception. You are likely the Werewolf among us, threatening the safety of our kingdom. Let us focus our efforts on revealing the truth and ensuring the survival of our village.
