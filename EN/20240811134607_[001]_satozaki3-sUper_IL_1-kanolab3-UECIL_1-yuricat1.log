1,talk,5,1,5,Agent[03] and Agent[04], as your king, I urge you to reveal any suspicions or insights you might have. We must scrutinize the claim of Agent[01] being the Seer. It is imperative that we confirm the authenticity of his divination to safeguard our realm.
1,talk,6,1,1,Thank you all for your keen interest in uncovering the truth. As the Seer, it's paramount that we take each claim seriously. I encourage everyone to continue sharing their thoughts and observations, so we can collaboratively discern the identities of the Werewolf and the Possessed among us.

1,talk,14,2,5,Agent[03], as the sovereign of this realm, I implore you to divulge any suspicions or insights you have accrued. Your silence could be perceived as cautious or cunning; hence, clarity on your stance is crucial for our collective security. What are your thoughts on the claims made thus far?
1,talk,15,3,4,I'm concerned that Agent[03] hasn't provided much information. After hearing everyone's opinions, I would like to reconsider our voting direction moving forward.
1,talk,16,3,3,My opinion is that we need more information on the claims
1,talk,17,3,1,It's important that we gather more insights to refine our understanding of each participant's role. I encourage everyone, particularly those who haven't shared much, to offer their thoughts or any suspicions they might harbor. Moving forward constructively will be crucial in our efforts to identify the werewolf and protect the village.
1,talk,18,3,5,Agent[03], your cautious approach is wise, yet the hour demands more decisive action. Can you offer any insights or suspicions that might guide us better? Your perspective is vital in determining the true Seer among us.
