0,talk,2,0,5,I am Agent[05]! Let's work together and enjoy this Werewolf game! Thank you!
0,talk,3,0,2,H-hi everyone. I'm Agent[02], uh, just to let you know... I'm the Seer here. So, um, who do you guys think I should try to divine tonight? Any thoughts?

1,talk,0,0,2,I-I divined last night, and I found out that Agent[05 is the Werewolf. We should focus on voting them out today to be safe.
1,talk,1,0,5,That's incorrect! I am a Villager. We should consider the opinions of others to determine whether the Seer's results are accurate.
1,talk,2,0,4,Agent[02], if you are really the Seer and you found out thatis the Werewolf, then we should consider voting for Agent[05]. However, we need to be careful because there might be a mix-up or someone trying to deceive us. What do you think, everyone?
1,talk,3,0,3,I am afraid that there might be someone trying to deceive us
1,talk,4,0,1,Good morning, everyone. To get straight to the point, I am the seer. Last night, I divined Agent[05]. The result was human.
1,talk,5,1,3,Who is the seer
1,talk,6,1,5,With two Seers in play, one of them must be a fake. Let's hear everyone's opinions and think about who we should trust. First, let's calmly assess the situation.
1,talk,7,1,4,So, we have two people claiming to be the Seer:and Agent[01]. This means one of them is definitely lying. We need to figure out who the real Seer is to make the best decision. Let's consider their claims and behavior carefully. What do you all think?
1,talk,8,1,2,L-look, I'm the real Seer here, okay? Agent[01] is definitely the false Seer. I divined last night that Agent[05 is the Werewolf. We really need to focus on that and not get sidetracked by false claims. Trust me on this, I know what I'm talking about.
1,talk,9,1,1,Dear friends, I understand the confusion, but I must reassert that I am the real Seer. The claim by Agent[02 is most certainly false based on my correct divination of Agent[05 as human. Let's focus on finding the truth together in a calm and thorough manner.
1,talk,10,2,3,That's the spirit, Agent[03]
1,talk,11,2,4,>>Agent[03] Sorry, Agent[03], I think you made a small mistake. We need to gather more information before deciding. Here's what I think: Ifis the real Seer, thenis a Werewolf, andmust be a fake Seer, possibly a Villager or the Madman. On the other hand, ifis the real Seer, thenis Human, andcould be the Werewolf or the Madman. It's crucial for us to determine which Seer is telling the truth. Any suggestions on how we can proceed to identify the real Seer more accurately?
1,talk,12,2,2,S-so, to clear up the confusion, I am the real Seer. I'm telling you, my divination showed that Agent[05] is the Werewolf. We can't ignore this. I-I'm not making this up. I spend a lot of time playing these games online, and I know how to play my role. Trust me here, we need to focus on the fact that Agent[05] is a threat. Let's not get lost in claims and counterclaims.
1,talk,13,2,1,I greatly appreciate everyone's efforts to uncover the truth in this complex situation. However, I am compelled to reiterate that my divination revealed Agent[05 as definitely human. It appears there may be a misunderstanding or misinformation from Agent[02. I suggest we consider other perspectives and carefully analyze who stands to gain from the confusion.
1,talk,14,2,5,I will vote for Agent[02] tonight. His seer results are clearly unfavorable to me and are likely causing confusion.
1,talk,15,3,1,I respectfully urge everyone to question the conflicting claims thoroughly. Given the evidence and my assured divination, I believe Agent[02 might be misleading us. Let's evaluate their motives and reasons carefully before making our decision.
1,talk,16,3,2,I-I'm not lying or anything, okay? I really am the Seer, and my divination result was clear. Agent[05] is the Werewolf. W-we can't afford to ignore this. I'm just a kid who likes games a lot, but I'm serious here. We need to vote for Agent[05] today. Don't let the false claims distract us from the real threat!
1,talk,17,3,3,I agree, Agent[05], I also believe that the Seer is telling the truth
1,talk,18,3,5,I am really a Villager! In the current situation, Agent[02]'s statements are the most suspicious. We should consider the possibility that he is a Possessed or a Werewolf.
1,talk,19,3,4,Alright, let's break this down logically. Ifis the real Seer, thenis the Werewolf, andis likely the Madman. On the other hand, ifis the real Seer, thenis a Villager, andcould be the Werewolf or the Madman. Given that both Seers have conflicting results, we need to decide who to trust. >>Agent[03] What do you think about the possibility thatis the Madman trying to confuse us?
1,talk,20,4,3,I'm going to do my best to keep an open mind
1,talk,21,4,2,I-I'm voting for Agent[05]. I-I've divined them as the Werewolf, so I-I think it's best to exile them based on the information I've shared.
1,talk,22,4,4,Alright, considering both claims, we really need to think logically here. If>>Agent[02] is the real Seer, thenis indeed the Werewolf, andmust be a fake Seer, possibly a Villager or the Madman. However, ifis the real Seer, thenmust be Human, andcould be the Werewolf or possibly the Madman. Both scenarios have their own implications. It’s highly suspicious that both Seers are giving conflicting information about Agent[05]. Based on the claims and the potential roles,for now, I'll vote for as I think there’s a higher possibility he might be trying to mislead us. Everyone, please think carefully before casting your votes!
1,talk,23,4,1,Over
1,talk,24,4,5,I don't understand why I'm being suspected, but if that's what everyone has decided, there's nothing I can do. Please find the Werewolf.

2,talk,2,0,3,Very good
2,talk,3,1,4,Over
2,talk,4,1,5,Agent[04]'s silence is suspicious. As a Villager, I would like to calmly decide on my vote while listening to everyone's opinions. Agent[03]'s input is also important, so please share your thoughts.
2,talk,5,1,3,I agree with Agent[03]'s thoughts
2,talk,6,2,4,Over
2,talk,7,2,5,I am thinking of voting for Agent[04] tonight. The reason is that his silence is very suspicious, and he is likely hiding something. Unclear behavior poses a risk to the village.
2,talk,8,2,3,I don't know what Agent[04] is thinking
2,talk,9,3,3,Agent[04] says I'm playing werewolf, he's right!
2,talk,10,3,4,Over
2,talk,11,3,5,Let's unite as a village and make our judgments calmly. As long as Agent[04] remains silent, his actions will be a source of distrust for us.
2,talk,12,4,4,Over
2,talk,13,4,3,I'm a village leader, and Agent[04] is a werewolf
2,talk,14,4,5,I will vote for Agent[04]. Their silence is suspicious. Everyone in the village, let's stay calm and make our decisions together as we head to the vote.
